                    Took part in a game jam at college and in 24 hours managed to make a 2D platformer in Unity called
                    "The Falling".
                </p>
                <p>
                    The theme for this game jam was "5 Seconds to live", and we were left to create our own groups with
                    the people who had turned up. I ended up partnering with an artist called <a
                        href="https://joshuafox.pb.design/" target="_bank">Joshua Fox </a> and together we
                    ended up creating "The Falling". For this game jam we kept it simple, neither of us had done one
                    before so we just stuck to something simple so that we would actually complete the game and be happy
                    with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was the programmer of the two, what I did was fixing the assets given to me in photoshop such as
                    removing backgrounds and changing sizes or exporting layers, importing that into unity, creating the
                    code for the game and creating the page on itch.io and gamejolt.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some issues I faced along the way while creating this game, was my first time using the particle
                    system in Unity. I first just added the component instead of using the game object which you can
                    spawn in, and also being confused in the sea of different options you could choose from. Exporting
                    to Web GL for the first time, and having issues with the camera changing size depending on that the
                    view size was on the browser. The way I went around this issue was by setting the fixed size of the
                    game in the browser to 1600x900, then I knew at that size you would definitely be able to see the
                    whole map when you play, however, it does mean people who have a smaller than that resolution for
                    their monitor have to zoom out to see it all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, I am happy with the final product and learnt new things about web GL and the particle
                    system and put to use using git command line instead of a nice GUI.
