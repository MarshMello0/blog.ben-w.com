                    Its been awhile.
                    <br>
                    The first post of 2019, and I'll be going through what I've been doing since the last post. At
                    this current point of time, I am currently studying at Northbrook MET doing Games Development Level
                    3
                    Extended Diploma. A week after I posted about finishing UERP I got my next unit, Unit 12.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each unit has a theme and an assignment brief you have to go through and complete, this unit the
                    theme
                    was "Nautical". Over those 9 weeks I had to write a critical report, do primary and secondary
                    research
                    about the theme, write about 4 possible game ideas, pick one and write a proposal, create test
                    pieces
                    based off that proposal and finally create the final product. Due to the short nature of these
                    assignments you can never really create a full game, it just ends up being a prototype.
                </p>

                <P>
                    My idea for unit 12 was based on the ".io" browser games, where you put in a nickname and hop in and
                    play to get the best on the leaderboard. The game wasn't to a finished state to how I dreamed of it
                    being, but that's what happens with all of these units, I only had 2 weeks of development and am
                    happy
                    with what I learnt during that process.
                </P>

                    So I've had to put things on hold as that was taking so much of my energy and time up, and now my
                    final
                    unit, Unit 13, seems to be doing the same and it's only the first week into it.
                </P>

                <p>
                    I've still been thinking of cool projects I want to get started on, here's a list of some of them.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Visual Scripting Editor for modding in Raft</li>
                        <li>Raspberry Pi radio for my car</li>
                        <li>VR Shopkeeper game</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At college, we also had an Industry day, where guest speakers came in and spoke about what they do
                    and
                    answered questions. One interesting thing which caught my eye was from a talk from Anthony Marmont,
                    previously studied at Northbrook then went on to working at TT Games in Brighton after completing
                    the
                    level 3 extended diploma. His talk was more of a ask me anything, but one thing I found interesting
                    was
                    when he showed the Github of his RPG Core Inventory system, the one thing which stood out was the
                    image
                    which looked to be visual node base behaviour for the items.
                </p>

                    This similar to what I want to do with the visual scripting editor for creating mods in Raft, so for
                    the
                    two days which I had free from handing in Unit 12, to starting Unit 13 I went through his code
                    seeing
                    how he achieved it in the unity editor. I managed to get it to read from a scriptable object their
                    mod
                    information and place a blank node on the screen which you can drag around and move around in the
                    window. Hopefully, I'll get some time to go into more detail about it in another blog post.

                    This was a longer post than normal, explaining what I've been up to. Hopefully, this final unit
                    won't be
                    too hard and I can keep working on stuff at home. If you made it this far, thanks for reading, I
                    don't
                    have any real way telling if people visit or read these pages, I'm just trying to share what I've
                    done
                    and improve on my writing. If you did want to follow this blog, the current only way is by watching
                    the Github repository <a href="https://github.com/MarshMello0/blog.ben-w.com" target="_blank">here</a>.
