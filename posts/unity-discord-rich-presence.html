                    I wanted to make some sort of tool for unity, not something which would be in a game but something
                    which would be used in the editor but it just needed to be a short simple idea I could just do in a
                    few days. I ended up coming up with the idea of creating a something which would display Discords
                    Rich Presence while you are in Unity, I thought of this as on my visual studio and visual studio
                    code there are plugins which do this for those software but I couldn't seem to find anything for
                    unity (with only a quick search on the internet).

                I have added discord rich presence to other projects for fun so I already had an idea how to add it to
                a unity project and get it working, I just had to learn how to code something for the Unity editor
                instead of runtime and I also have had a brief look into publishing assets on to the assets store
                before so I had a vague idea of how I needed to create this so I jumped right into Unity and created a
                new project with the first name which came into my head "UnityEditorDiscordRichPresence", a bit of a
                mouth full.

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">
                Got the discord rpc set up and working then starting on the main part, code for the editor to call the
                discord rpc, I first wanted just to get some drop-down menu from the top bar which I knew was a simple
                one line of code but I had only done it once before so after a few minutes of searching around on the
                internet I finally found it.

                        [MenuItem("EditorRichPresence/Enable Rich Presence")]
                </code>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col">

                Once I had my menu at the top the rest I already had experience in as I have created a discord rich
                presence for a previous project, so then I managed to get a working in a few days. Next, I am going to
                be working on the art and testing to it to see if its ready to release it.
